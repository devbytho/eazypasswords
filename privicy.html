    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 24, 2025</p>

    <p>At SecurePass ("we", "us", or "our"), we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the minimum amount of data required to provide our password management service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We collect your Name and Email Address to manage your account, verify your identity, and allow you to log in.</li>
        <li><strong>Vault Metadata:</strong> We store the names of websites (URLs), usernames, categories, and notes associated with your stored items so we can display them in your dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypted Data:</strong> Your passwords and sensitive fields are encrypted. We store the encrypted "blob" (ciphertext). We cannot read your passwords in plain text.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We log basic activity (such as "Login" or "Password Updated"), IP address, and country code for security auditing purposes and to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the SecurePass service.</li>
        <li>To verify your identity via email verification codes.</li>
        <li>To notify you about changes to our service or security alerts (e.g., new device logins).</li>
        <li>To detect and prevent fraudulent or abusive use of our services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Security is our top priority. We use industry-standard cryptographic protocols to protect your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM.</li>
        <li><strong>Hashing:</strong> Master passwords and PINs are hashed using PBKDF2 with high iteration counts before storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> All data transmitted between your device and our servers is protected using TLS/SSL (HTTPS).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may share strictly necessary data with the following trusted third-party service providers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloudflare:</strong> For hosting, database storage, and security protection (DDoS mitigation).</li>
        <li><strong>Resend:</strong> For delivering verification emails and security alerts.</li>
        <li><strong>Have I Been Pwned:</strong> We may send a partial hash (prefix) of passwords to check for known data breaches. Your full password is never sent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>We retain your data only as long as your account is active.</p>
    <p><strong>You have full control over your data.</strong> You can delete your account at any time through the "Settings" menu in the application. Upon deletion, all your data, including your account details and stored passwords, is permanently removed from our databases and cannot be recovered.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
